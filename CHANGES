RegAligner Change History

*** release version 1.0 (released on December 09 2012) ***
- parameterization of HMM now selectable on command line, plus added some variants
- added options to the IBM-3: 
  probability for empty word can now be fixed on command line, the original empty word of Brown et al. can be used
  and nonparametric distortion models can be used
- added options to the IBM-4:
  + (like in the IBM-3) probability for empty word can now be fixed and the original empty word of Brown et al. can be used
  + option to use a more deficient variant (according to Brown et al.)
- IBM-4 now implements word classes
- speed-up for Viterbi computation of HMM with reduced parameterization
- HMM Viterbi prob is now returned as a long double
- bugfix in count collection for IBM-4
- bugfix in m-step for parametric distortion in IBM-3, plus now using non-trivial initialization
- small bugfixes for HMM, plus extended Viterbi-mode
- improved some numerical issues
- added option -dont-print-energy to speed up computations (while reducing output information)

*** release version 0.92 (released on May 08 2012)
- can now specify a fertility limit for IBM-3/4
- improved speed of hillclimbing in IBM-4
- made ICM a little more extensive
- speed-ups for ICM in IBM-4


**** release version 0.9
- first released version, May 02 2012
