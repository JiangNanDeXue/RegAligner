This toolkit primarily implements the papers

[Schoenemann, CoNLL 2011]

and

[Schoenemann, IJCNLP 2011]

with additional features. It also reimplements the paper [Vaswani, Huang,
Chiang ACL 2012], which uses L0-norms together with EM.


At the same time, it is an adequate replacement for
GIZA++ as the models IBM-1,2,3,4 and HMM are implemented. 

There are a few restrictions however:
- support for the IBM-2 is limited.
- pegging is not implemented (and usually too slow, anyway)
- when moving from one model to the next, there is no count collection 
  from the previous model. Rather, novel parameters are initialized uniformly.
- smoothing (e.g. for HMMs) is not implemented

On the other hand, there are some additional features:
- implementation of regularity terms (L_0 and weighted L_1)
- the EM-algorithm for the HMM is closer to the model (see [Schoenemann, IJCNLP 2011])
- IBM-3 allows a reduction of the alignment parameters by
  pooling over all sentence lengths.
- variants of IBM-4 where instead of the center of a cept one can take the head or the tail
- we implement posterior decoding (not active by default)
- refined Viterbi training mode with ICM stage (useful with L_0-norms)
- training the IBM-3 with the ITG constraints and the IBM constraints is supported
- computation of IBM-3 Viterbi alignments via ILPs is integrated
- we use long double precision

BUILDING REGALIGNER

A sample Makefile has been provided, but you will most likely have to modify
it. 

DEPENDENCIES

There are no mandatory dependencies. However, if you want to be able to read zipped files,
you need to download the gzstream classes from the University of North Carolina:
http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream/ . To use this class, add -DHAS_GZSTREAM
to the compiler options and link against gzstream. Make sure that you are
using these classes in accordance with the respective license conditions.


USING REGALIGNER
