This toolkit primarily implements the papers

[Schoenemann, CoNLL 2011]

and

[Schoenemann, IJCNLP 2011]

with additional features. At the same time, it is an adequate replacement for
GIZA++ as the models IBM-1,2,3,4 and HMM are implemented. 

There are a few restrictions however:
- support for the IBM-2 is limited.
- for IBM-4 there is currently no dependence on word classes 

On the other hand, there are some additional features:
- implementation of regularity terms
- IBM-3 allows a reduction of the alignment parameters by
  pooling over all sentence lengths.
